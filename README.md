# ☕️ Java torture deluxe
Welcome to Java hell... er, I mean: to my wonderful Java practice paradise!
## 🔍 What is this?
A collection of small Java exercises that I have designed and (more or less voluntarily) solved myself. Perfect for all those who:
- 🧠 want to train their brain,
- 🤯 like to despair of loops and if-statements,
- 🐞 hunt bugs
- or just want to see how it can *also* be done (not always nice, but rarely boring).
## 💡 Why all this?
Because learning works best when you laugh - or cry. Or both at the same time.  
Plus, it's pretty cool to look back at some point and think: *"Wow. I thought that was hard back then. "*
